# Stock Trading Alert
Queries stock trading API to check for company's closing share prices in the previous 2 days. Sends an SMS via Twilio's SMS API to user's phone number(s) before market opens in case share price has dipped below a threshold percentage in the last 2 days with share information and latest news articles for that company.

I used [AlphaVantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) for company share prices and [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to extract the news articles for the company.

## Prerequisites:
- Create an account in [AlphaVantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) & [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and generate your API keys.
- Create an account in [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us), generate your Twilio phone number, verify your personal number(s) and set aside your Twilio Auth Token and Account SID.
- Create environment variables containing your private API keys and tokens within your local environment by typing in terminal:
  
  ```bash
   export ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=alphavantage_api_key
   export NEWS_API_KEY=news_api_key
   export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=twilio_api_key
  ```
  
- Python 3.9 & up

### To run in terminal:
- Open Powershell in the local repository folder
- Type:

  ```bash
   python main.py
  ```
